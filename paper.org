* Abstract

  \bfseries

  Neocortical processing of sensory input rely on the specific
  activation of subpopulations within the cortical network. Though
  specific circuitry is thought to be the primary mechanism underlying
  this functional principle, we investigate here how diverse
  biophysical features in single neuron might contribute to such
  specific activation. 

  In a companion study [[cite:Zerlaut2016]], we reported that, in young
  mice visual cortex, individual neurons differ not only in their
  excitability but also in their sensitivities to the properties of
  the membrane potential fluctuations. In the present work, we analyze
  how this heterogeneity is translated into diverse input-ouput
  properties (i.e. in the relation from presynaptic quantities to
  spiking probability). 

  We designed a simplified morphological model of layer V pyramidal
  neurons with a dendritic tree following Rall's branching rule. We
  first show that we are able to calibrate this simplified model on
  /in vitro/ measurements of somatic input impedance. We then propose
  an analytical derivation for the membrane potential fluctuations at
  the soma as a function of the properties of the synaptic
  bombardment. This mathematical description allows to easily emulate
  various forms of presynaptic activities: either balanced,
  unbalanced, synchronized, purely proximal or purely distal synaptic
  activity. We found that those different forms of activity led to
  various comodulations of the membrane potential fluctuation
  properties, thus raising the question whether individual neurons
  might differentially couple to specific forms of activity because of
  their various firing responses to fluctuations [[cite:Zerlaut2016]]. We
  indeed found such an heterogenous response, but trivially, the only
  significant contribution to the various firing response was the
  different levels of cellular excitability (linked to the action
  potential threshold level). A notable exception appeared for
  proximal activity: increasing proximal activity could either promote
  firing response in some cells or suppress it in some other cells
  whatever their individual excitability. This behavior could only be
  explained by various sensitivities to the speed of the fluctuations,
  that was previously linked to heterogenous levels of sodium
  inactivation and sodium channels density.

  In addition to giving quantitative insight on the impact of various
  excitability levels in individual neurons, the present study
  suggests a new functional impact of biophysical heterogeneity:
  various levels of density of sodium channels and sodium inactivation
  will control the response of individual neurons to proximal
  activity.

* Introduction

Neocortical processing of sensory input rely on the specific
activation of subpopulations within the cortical network. The details
of how such specific activations happens are key questions in systems
neuroscience.

Neocortical neurons differ in their afferent connectivity. For
example, in the somato-sensory cortex of rodents, neurons in two
different barrels sample inputs from different locations in the
thalamus nucleus. Neocortical neurons also vary in their
electrophysiological properties. For example, heterogenous levels in
the action potential threshold are routinely measured both in vivo
[[Nowak, etc]] and in vitro [[refs]]. An emerging picture is that the
sensitivity of a neuron to a given feature results from the
combination of its circuit specificity (relative to this feature) and
its biophysical specificity.  The somato-sensory cortex study of
[[citetext:Crochet2011]] illustrates this point precisely.  During active
touch, the response probability of a neuron (its sensitivity to
whisker touch) follows from the combination of the reached level of
synaptically-driven membrane potential deflection (resulting from its
circuit-specificity) and its threshold for action potential triggering
(its biophysical specificity). The same result hold for texture
recognition in the study of [[citetext:Yang2015]] where the combination of
the two mentionned effect correlated with the [[xx, to be checked]] in
barrel cortex neurons.

# Therefore highlighting the role of the interaction between circuit
# afference and biophysics for stimulus representation at the single
# neuron level in sensory cortex.

In the present work, we investigate such interactions in the light of
the variability in the biophysical features reported in
[[citetext:Zerlaut2016]], namely that single neurons in juvenile mice
cortex not only vary in their excitability (linked to the action
potential threshold) but also in their sensitivity to the properties
of the membrane potential fluctuations. We introduced new dimensions
in the /biophysical specificity/ and we now aim at understanding their
functional impact.

We thus designed a theoretical model for passive dendritic integration
that allows an analytical treatment and thus easily enables the
implementation of various types of presynaptic activity. It is based
on a symmetrical morphology where branching follows the Rall's 3/2
exponent rule [[cite:Rall1962]], the analytical derivation relies on
adapting the equivalent cylinder transformation [[cite:Rall1962]] to the
properties of the high conductance state [[cite:Destexhe2003]].

We implemented various types of presynaptic activity: either
unbalanced, purely proximal, purely distal or synchronized. We found
that those various types of activity corrresponds to different
variations of the properties of the membrane potential fluctuations
(mean depolarization, standard deviation and autocorrelation
time). The various firing responses (as a function of the fluctuation
properties) for individual neurons found in our companion study then
led to diverse coupling to each activity type. Taken together, our two
studies suggest that [...]

The results are organized as follows. We first formulate our
theoretical framework for cellular computation which arbitrarily
separate the question of dendritic integration and spiking
probability. Then we present our simplified model of dendritic
morphology which we calibrated on /in vitro/ measurements. We derive
an analytical approximation for the membrane potential fluctuations at
the soma that we compare to numerical simulations using standard

** A theoretical framework for single cell computation in the fluctuation-driven regime

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width \linewidth
#+NAME: fig:model-illustration
#+CAPTION: *A theoretical framework for single cell computation in the fluctuation-driven regime*. *(A)* Theoretical paradigm: to get the input-output function of a single cell, we split the relation from presynaptic quantities (the input) to the spiking probability (the output) into two steps. 1) passive dendritic integration shape the membrane potential at the soma and 2) how those fluctuations are translated into spikes is captured by a firing response function determined /in vitro/ [[cite:Zerlaut2016]] *(B)* Theoretical model for dendritic integration. A single cell is made of a lumped impedance somatic compartment and a dendritic tree. The dendritic tree is composed of B branches (here B=5), the branching is symmetric and follow Rall's 3/2 rule for the branch diameters. Synapses are then spread all over the membrane according to physiological synaptic densities. We define 3 domains: a somatic and proximal domain as well as a distal domain, excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input can vary independently in those domains. An additional variable: synaptic synchrony controls the degree of coincidents synaptic inputs.
[[file:./figures/model_illustration.png]]

Determining the cellular input-output functions is complex because
input of neocortical neurons are mostly in dendrites and output spikes
are generated in initial segments of an axon as reviewed in
[[citetext:Stuart2015]] and [[citetext:Debanne2011]] input will therefore
crucially shape their input-output relationship. Various parameters of
presynaptic activity can arbitrarily control the properties of the
membrane potential fluctuations at the soma. Those properties can be
quantified by identifying three somatic variables that provide a
reduced description of the dynamical state at the soma in the
/fluctuation-driven/ regime: the mean \mu_V, the standard deviation
\sigma_V of the membrane potential fluctuations and their typical
autocorrelation time $\tau_V$. For example, the excitatory/inhibitory
balance controls the mean depolarization at the soma \mu_V, the mean
synaptic bombardment impacts the standard deviation \sigma_V and the
speed of the membrane potential fluctuations \tau_V. Other effects
such as synchrony in the presynaptic spike trains or ratio between
distally and proximally targeting synaptic activity also affect the
statistical properties of the fluctuations. The effects of synaptic
input and its dendritic integration on somatic variables can be
investigated theoretically using cable theory [[cite:Tuckwell2002]] and
will be the focus of a future communication.

Because the spike initiation site lies electrotonically close to the
soma [[cite:Debanne2011]], we assume that those three purely somatic
variables will define the firing rate uniquely. In this study we
investigate the firing response in terms of those somatic variables.

The morphology of our theoretical model is a lumped impedance somatic
compartment in parallel with a dendritic arborization of symmetric
branching following Rall's 3/2 branching rule (see Figure
[[fig:model-illustration]]B and Methods[[sec:morphology]]). This morphology is
of course a very reductive description of pyramidal cells: it does not
discriminate between the distinct apical trunk and the very dense
basal arborization. Also branching in pyramidal cell morphologies have
been shown to deviate from Rall's 3/2 branching rule. Nonetheless

We emphasize here that even if the analytical description uses the
reduction to the equivalent cylinder (and therefore could be seen as
equivalent to the Ball and Stick model), the described model has
separate branches so that the fluctuations are uncorrelated from

branches to branches unlike in the Ball and Stick model.

* Discussion

In this communication, by introducing an analytically tractable
dendritic model, we presented the final form of our theoretical
framework for single cell computation in the fluctuation-driven
regime.

** An analytical model for dendritic integration in the fluctuation-driven regime

we provided a stratey for the analytical treatment of dendritic
integration in the fluctuation-driven regime that relies on 1)
shotnoise theory, 2) cable theory and 3) adequate approximations.

The main advantage of this model is that you can very naturall plug in
physiological parameters (because surface area is physiological as
well as transfer resistance to soma) and still it remains analytical.

Literature suffers from the reduction to single-compartment

The current model provides a tool to make network dynamics question
amenable to mathematical analysis with morphologically detailed
models.

Rely on calculating PSP events and opens the way toward event based
simulations of dendritic integration in the high conductance state
(though including approximation).

** Limitations of the proposed theoretical framework for single-cell computation

** Heterogeneity of morpological and passive neuronal properties

In this study, the rescaling rule between input resistance at the soma
and the size of the morphological model has led to the invariance in
the relation between input (presynaptic variables) and the fluctuation
properties. Thus the heterogeneity in morpholgies (here only cell
sizes) had very little effects on the heterogeneity of cell responses.

<<sec:morphology>>

The morphology of our theoretical model is the following (depicted in
Figure [[fig:model-illustration]]B): it is made of an isopotential somatic
compartment (i.e. a leaky RC circuit) in parallel with a dendritic
structure. The dendritic tree is an arborization of total length L_t
containing B generation of branches. For simplicity all branches of a
generation \( b \in [1, B]\) have a length L_t/B. From one generation
to the other, a branch divides into two branches where the diameter of
the daughter branches follows Rall's 3/2 branching rule [[cite:Rall1962]]:
\( (d_{b+1})^{\frac{3}{2}} = (d_{b})^{\frac{3}{2}} /2 \), i.e. d_b =
2^{-\frac{2}{3}} d_t \) where d_t in the diameter of the root branch
of the dendritic tree.

** Model equations: synaptic input and passive properties
<<sec:model-equations>>

The cable equation describes the temporal evolution and spatial spread
of the membrane potential along the branches of the dendritic tree
[[cite:Rall1962]]:

#+NAME: eq:cable
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{r_i} \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2} = i_m(v, x, t) = c_m \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + \frac{v-E_L}{r_m} - i_{syn}(v,x,t)
\end{equation}

the membrane current $i_m(v, x, t)$ is a linear density of current
(the presented cable equation already includes the radial
symmetry). Though the modeled system has several branches, the
equation can be written as a single spatial dependency $x$ because the
symmetry of the model across branches imply that the properties of the
input are identical at a given distance to the soma.

Synaptic input is modeled by local (infinitely small) and transient
changes of membrane permeability to selective ionic channels. Both
excitatory (accounting for AMPA synapses) and inhibitory synapses
(accounting for GABAa synapses) are considered, their reversal
potential is E_e=0mV and E_i=-80mV respectively. Each synaptic event
is generated by a shotnoise and its effect on the conductance is a
jump followed by an exponential decay. The form of the synaptic
current is therefore:

#+NAME: eq:synaptic-currents
\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{split}
& i_{syn}(v,x,t) = g_e(x,t)(E_e-v)+g_i(x,t)(E_i-v) \\
& g_e(x,t) = \sum_{\big\{x_e, \{t_e\} \big\}} \delta(x-x_e) \sum_{t_e} \mathcal{H}(t-t_e) Q_e(x) \, e^{-\frac{t-t_e}{\tau_e(x)}} \\
& g_i(x,t) = \sum_{\big\{x_i, \{t_i\} \big\}} \delta(x-x_i) \sum_{t_i} \mathcal{H}(t-t_i) Q_i(x) \, e^{-\frac{t-t_i}{\tau_i(x)}}\\
\end{split}
\right.
\end{equation}

where $g_e$ and $g_i$ are linear densities of conductances. Each
synapse, indexed by $s$, has a position $x_s$ and a set of presynaptic
events \(\{t_s\}\), hence the iteration over \( \big\{x_s, \{t_s\}
\big\} \) for the sum over synapses for each synaptic
type. $\mathcal{H}$ is the Heaviside step function. The presynaptic
events $\{t_s\}$ are generated by point processes at fixed frequencies
$\nu_s$ with a given degree of synchrony, see details in the next
section[[sec:presyn-point-process]].

The model distinguishes two domains : a proximal domain with the upper
index $p$ and a distal domain with the upper index $d$ (see Figure
[[fig:model-illustration]]). Then the space-dependent quantities
(presynaptic frequencies, synaptic quantal and synaptic decay time
constant) can be written as :

#+NAME: eq:space-dep-quant
\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{split}
& \nu_e(x) = \nu_e^P + (\nu_e^d - \nu_e^p) \mathcal{H}(x-l_p)\\
&\nu_i(x) = \nu_i^P + (\nu_i^d - \nu_i^p) \mathcal{H}(x-l_p) \\
& Q_e(x) = Q_e^P + (Q_e^d - Q_e^p) \mathcal{H}(x-l_p)\\
& Q_i(x) = Q_i^P + (Q_i^d - Q_i^p) \mathcal{H}(x-l_p) \\
&\tau_e(x) = \tau_e^P + (\tau_e^d - \tau_e^p) \mathcal{H}(x-l_p)\\
&\tau_i(x) = \tau_i^P + (\tau_i^d - \tau_i^p) \mathcal{H}(x-l_p) 
\end{split}
\right.
\end{equation}

The continuity of the membrane potential and of the current at the
boundaries between the proximal and distal part imply:

\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{split}
& v(l_p^-,t) = v(l_p^+,t) \\
& \frac{1}{r_i} \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}_{l_p^-} 
= \frac{1}{r_i} \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}_{l_p^+} 
\end{split}
\right.
\end{equation}

where the limit with upper index $\pm$ indicate the limit taken from
the left or the right respectively.

At the soma, $(x=0)$, we have a lumped impedance compartment. It has
leaky RC circuit properties and also receives synaptic inhibition, the
somatic membrane potential therefore follows :

\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{split}
& C_M \frac{dV}{dt} + \frac{V-E_L}{R_M} + G_I(t) \, (V-E_i)  + I(t) = 0 \\
& G_i(t) = \sum_{N_i} \sum_{\{t_i\}} Q_i^p \, e^{-\frac{-(t-t_i)}{\tau_i^p}} \, \mathcal{H}(t-t_i)
\end{split}
\right.
\end{equation}

where $I(t)$ is the time-dependent input current from the soma into
the dendrite. $R_M$ and $C_M$ are the RC properties of the lumped
compartment (capital letters will indicate the somatic properties
throughout the calculus). $N_i$ is the number of somatic synapses,
each of them generates a point process $\{t_i\}$ of inhibitory
synaptic events. The properties of the somatic synapses $(\nu_i^S,
Q_i^S)$ are equivalent to the proximal ones.

This equation with the membrane potential continuity will determine
the boundary condition at the soma (x=0). We identify $V(t)=v(0,t)$,
then $I(t)$ is the current input into the dendritic tree at $x=0$ so
it verifies:

\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}_{|x=0}} = - r_i \, I(t)
\end{equation}

So:
#+NAME: eq:soma-bound
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}_{|x=0} = r_i \, 
\Big( C_M \frac{\partial v}{\partial t}_{|x=0} + \frac{v(0,t)-E_L}{R_m} + G_I(t) \, ( v(0,t)-E_i) \Big)
\end{equation}

Finally, the last boundary condition is that all branches terminate with an infinite resistance that impede current flow (sealed-end boundary conditions):

#+NAME: eq:end-bound
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}_{x=l} = 0
\end{equation}

Together with the biased Poisson process for event generation (see
the next section[[sec:presyn-point-process]]), the final set of equations
that describes the model, is therefore:

#+NAME: eq:model-equation
\begin{equation}
\left\{
\begin{split}
& \frac{1}{r_i} \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2} = 
c_m \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + \frac{v-E_L}{r_m} - i_{syn}(v,x,t)\\
& \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}_{|x=0} = r_i \, 
\Big( C_M \frac{\partial v}{\partial t}_{|x=0} + \\
& \qquad \qquad \frac{v(0,t)-E_L}{R_m} + G_I(t) \, ( v(0,t)-E_i) \Big) \\
& v(l_p^-,t) = v(l_p^+,t) \\
& \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}_{l_p^-} 
= \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}_{l_p^+} \\
& \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}_{x=l} = 0
\end{split}
\right.
\end{equation}

** Model of presynaptic activity
<<sec:presyn-point-process>>

Presynaptic activity is modelled as a discrete set of presynaptic
events. Because of the apparent random spiking activity in the
fluctuation-driven regime, the basis for the generation of those
discrete events is the Poisson process. Nonetheless, we want to
reproduce the additional degree of presynaptic synchrony found in
neocortical asssemblies that result mainly for two phenomena: 1)
pairwise correlation between neurons [[refs]] and 2) muti-innervation of a
cell by a presynaptic neuron [[refs]]. We therefore introduce a variable
\(s\) that will bias the event generation of the Poisson process (\(s
\in [0,1]\)). For simplicity in the analytical treatment, synchrony in
presynaptic activity is not shared across different synapses. We
arbitrarily limit the number of coincident events to four events,
therefore for a degree of synchrony \(s\): single events have a
probability \(1-s\), double events have a probability \(s-s^2\),
triple events events have a probability \(s^2-s^3\) and quadruple
events have a probability \(s^3\). To generate a biased Poisson
process of frequency \(\nu\) with a degree of synchrony \(s\), we
therefore generate a Poisson process of frequency:

#+NAME: eq:new-freq-with-correl
\begin{equation}
\nu_{synch} = \frac{\nu}{1+s+s^2+s^3}
\end{equation}

and we duplicate (from up to four events) each event according to
their probabilities of occurence.

This is a very simplistic and limited model of presynaptic synchrony
but it is sufficient for reproducing the impact of synchrony on the
quantities investigated in this paper (only the variance of the
membrane potential fluctuations).

** Numerical implementation
<<numerical-implementation>>

The full model has been implemented numerically using the =NEURON=
software. The branched morhology was created and passive cable
properties were introduced. The spatial discretization was =nseg=30=
segments per branch. On each segment, one excitatory and one
inhibitory synapse were created, the shotnoise frequency was then
scaled according to the segment area and the synaptic density to
account for the number of synapses on this segment (using the
properties of the Poisson process, N synapses at frequency $\nu$ is a
synapse at frequency $N\nu$). Custom event generation was implemented
to introduce correlations (instead of classical =NetStim=) and fed
=NetCon= objects attached to each synapses (=ExpSyn= synapses).

** Analytical derivation of the fluctuation properties: strategy
<<sec:strategy>>

We present here a derivation that provides an analytical approximation
for the properties of the fluctuations of the membrane potential at
the soma for our model. Summing up its properties, we get: 1) a
morphology with a lumped somatic compartement and a dendritic tree of
symmetric branching following Rall's rule 2) conductance-based
synapses 3) independent excitatory and inhibitory shotnoise input
spread all over the morphology 4) assymetric properties between a
proximal part and a distal part and 5) a certain degree of synchrony
in the pre-synaptic spikes.

The properties of the membrane potential fluctuations at the soma
correspond to three stationary statistical properties of the
fluctuations: their mean $\mu_V$, their standard deviation
\(\sigma_V\) and their /global/ autocorrelation time
\(\tau_V\). Following [[citetext:Zerlaut2016]], we emphasize that the
/global/ autocorrelation time is a partial description of the
autocorrelation function (as the autocorrelation function is not
exponential) but it constitutes the first order description of the
temporal dynamics of the fluctuations.

A commonly adopted strategy in the /fluctuation-driven/ regime to
obtain statistical properties is to use stochastic calculus after
having performed the /diffusion approximation/, i.e. approximating the
synaptic conductance time course by a stochastic process, see
e.g. [[cite:Tuckwell2002]]). This approach is nonetheless not easily
generalizable to conductance input in an extended structure and render
the inclusion of assymetric properties (proximal vs distal)
complicated. We rather propose here an approach that combines
simplifying assumptions and analytical results from shotnoise theory,
it constitutes an extension of the approach proposed in
[[citetext:Kuhn2004]].

For each set of synaptic stimulation \(\{\nu^e_p, \nu_i^p, \nu_e^d,
\nu_i^d, s\}\), the derivation corresponds to the following steps:

- We transform the dendritic structure to its equivalent cylinder. The
  reduction to the equivalent cylinder is "activity-dependent" and
  captures the changes in membrane properties that results from the
  mean synaptic conductance levels.

- We derive a mean membrane potential \(\mu_V(x)\) corresponding to
  the stationary response to constant densities of conductances given
  by the means of the synaptic stimulation. We use this
  space-dependent membrane potential \(\mu_V(x)\) to fix the driving
  force all along the membrane for all synapses. The relation between
  synaptic events and the membrane potential now becomes linear.

- We derive a new cable equation that describes the variations of the
  membrane potential around this $\mu_V(x)$ solution. 

- We calculate the effect of one synaptic event on a branch \(b, b\in
  [1,B]\) at a distance $x$. We calculate the post-synaptic membrane
  potential event \($PSP_b(x,t)\) at the soma resulting from $b$
  synchronous synaptic events occuring at the distance $x$ from the
  soma. We approximate the effect of only one event by rescaling the
  response by the number of input \($PSP_b(x,t)/b\).

- We use shotnoise theory to compute the power spectrum density of the
  membrane potential fluctuations resulting from all excitatory and
  inhibitory synaptic events (including the synchrony between events).

The full derivation has been conducted with the help of the python
modulus for symbolic computation: =sympy= (deriving homogenous
solutions is relatively simple but computing coefficients with the
boudaries conditions give rise to complex expressions because of the
number of parameters). The resulting expression were then exported to
=numpy= functions for numerical evaluation. The =ipython= notebook
that presents the full derivation is available on the following [[http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/urls/bitbucket.org/yzerlaut/diverse_coupling_to_synaptic_activity/raw/master/notebooks/Fluctuations_at_soma_for_Ball_&_Rall_tree.ipynb][link]].

** Experimental preparation and electrophysiological recordings
<<sec:exp-prep>>

Experiments were performed at Unité de Neurosciences, Information et
Complexité, Gif sur Yvette, France. Experimental procedures with
animals were performed following the instructions of the European
Council Directive 2010 86/609/EEC and its French transposition (Décret
2013/118). Experimental methods were identical to those presented in
[[citetext:Zerlaut2016]]. Very briefly, we performed intracellular
recordings in the current-clamp mode using the perforated patch
technique on layer V pyramidal neurons of coronal slices of juvenile
mice primary visual cortex. For the n=13 cells presented in this
study, the access resistance R_S was [[XX]] M\(\Omega\) \(\pm\) [[YY]], the
leak current at -75mV was [[XX]] pA \(\pm\) [[YY]], cells had an input
resistance R_m of [[XX]] M$\Omega$ \(\pm\) [[YY]] and a membrane time constant
at rest of [[XX]] ms \(\pm\) [[YY]].

** Input impedance characterization
<<sec:measured-quant>>

 To determine the input impedance at the soma, we injected sinusoidal
 currents in the current-clamp mode of the amplifier (Multiclamp 700B,
 Molecular Devices), we recorded the membrane potential response to a
 current input of the form \(I(t)=I \, \sin(2\pi \, f \, t) \), we
 varied the frequencies $f$ and amplitudes $I over 40 episodes per
 cell. The frequency range scanned was [0.1, 500] Hz. For each cell,
 we determined manually the current amplitude $I_0$ that gave a \sim
 5mV amplitude in a current step protocol, from this value, the value
 of $I$ was scaled exponentially between $I_0$ at 0.1 Hz and \(50
 I_0\) at 500Hz. The reason for varying the current amplitude (and not
 only the oscillation frequency) in those input impedance protocols is
 to anticipate for the low pass filtering of the membrane and insure
 that the membrane potential response at high frequencies is far above
 the electronic noise level (\sim 0.1 mV).

After removing the first 3 periods of the oscillations (to avoid
transient effects), we fitted the membrane potential response to the
form:

\begin{equation}
V(t) = E_L + R \, I \, \sin(2\pi \, f \, t - \phi)
\end{equation}

where \(E_L, R\) and $\phi$ were fitted with a least-square
minimization procedure. The frequency dependent values of $R$ and
$\phi$ give the modulus and phase shift of the input impedance
presented in Figure [[fig:in-vitro-calib]]A

** Calibration of the morphologies
** Numerical tools

All numerical simulations of single cell dynamics have been performed
with custom code written in the numerical library of =python=: =numpy=
and optimized with the =numba= library. For the neuronal model, each
point (a mean output frequency and its standard deviation across
trials) corresponds to numerical simulations running with a time step
dt=0.01ms, for a duration of 10s and repeated 4 times with different
seeds (one simulation duration: $\sim$ 2s of real time on a Dell
Optiplex 9020 desktop computer). Experimental protocols and
online-analysis have been written in =Elphy2=. Plots and data analysis
have been done thanks to the =SciPy= package.
