* Abstract

  \bfseries

  Characterizing the input-output properties of neocortical neurons is
  of crucial importance to understand the properties emerging at the
  network level. In a companion communication [[(Zerlaut et al., 2016)]],
  we reported how individual neurons differ in their excitability and
  sensitivities to the properties of the membrane potential
  fluctuations. In the present report, we investigate how this
  heterogeneity is translated into diverse input-ouput properties 

  We study the coupling to different form of presynaptic activities,
  either balanced, unbalanced, proximal, distal, etc..

  In this letter, we investigate the

* Discussion

** An analytical model for dendritic integration in the fluctuation-driven regime

we provided a stratey for the analytical treatment of dendritic
integration in the fluctuation-driven regime that relies on 1)
shotnoise theory, 2) cable theory and 3) adequate approximations.

The main advantage of this model is that you can very naturall plug in
physiological parameters (because surface area is physiological as
well as transfer resistance to soma) and still it remains analytical.

** Heterogeneity of morpological and passive neuronal properties

In this study, the rescaling rule between input resistance at the soma
and the morphological model has led to the

** Experimental preparation and electrophysiological recordings
<<sec:exp-prep>>

Experimental methods were identical to those presented in
[[citet:Zerlaut2016]]. Very briefly, we performed intracellular
patch-clamp recordings using the perforated patch technique on layer V
pyramidal neurons of coronal slices of juvenile mice primary visual
cortex. For the n=13 cells presented in this study, the access
resistance R_S was [[XX]] M\(\Omega\) \(\pm\) [[YY]], the leak current at
-75mV was [[XX]] pA \(\pm\) [[YY]], cells had an input resistance R_m of [[XX]]
M$\Omega$ \(\pm\) [[YY]] and a membrane time constant at rest of [[XX]] ms
\(\pm\) [[YY]].

** Input impedance characterization
<<sec:measured-quant>>

 To determine the input impedance at the soma, we injected sinusoidal
 currents in the current-clamp mode of the amplifier (Multiclamp 700B,
 Molecular Devices), we recorded the membrane potential response to a
 current input of the form \(I(t)=I \, \sin(2\pi \, f \, t) \), we
 varied the frequencies $f$ and amplitudes $I over 40 episodes per
 cell. The frequency range scanned was [0.1, 500] Hz. For each cell,
 we determined manually the current amplitude $I_0$ that gave a \sim
 5mV amplitude in a current step protocol, from this value, the value
 of $I$ was scaled exponentially between $I_0$ at 0.1 Hz and $50 I_0$
 at 500Hz. The reason for varying the current amplitude (and not only
 the oscillation frequency) in those input impedance protocols is to
 anticipate for the low pass filtering of the membrane and insure that
 the membrane potential response at high frequencies is far above the
 electronic noise level (\sim 0.1 mV).

After removing the first 3 periods of the oscillations (to avoid
transient effects), we fitted the membrane potential response to the
form:

\begin{equation}
V(t) = E_L + R \, I \, \sin(2\pi \, f \, t + \phi)
\end{equation}

where $E_L$, $R$ and $\phi$ were fitted with a least-square
minimization procedure. The frequency dependent values of $R$ and
$\phi$ give the modulus and phase shift of the input impedance
presented in Figure [[fig:in-vitro-calib]]A

** Numerical tools
<<sec:numerical-tools>>

All numerical simulations of single cell dynamics have been performed
with custom code written in the numerical library of =python=: =numpy=
and optimized with the =numba= library. For the neuronal model, each
point (a mean output frequency and its standard deviation across
trials) corresponds to numerical simulations running with a time step
dt=0.01ms, for a duration of 10s and repeated 4 times with different
seeds (one simulation duration: $\sim$ 2s of real time on a Dell
Optiplex 9020 desktop computer). Experimental protocols and
online-analysis have been written in =Elphy2=. Plots and data analysis
have been done thanks to the =SciPy= package.
